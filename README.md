TypeBank UD Gothic is a UD Gothic typeface with excellent readability and design balance. In order to make the Kanji characters more identifiable, the letters are simplified by omitting the unnecessary Hane (flick strokes) and Geta (vertical strokes extending through horizontal strokes at the bottom of Kanji). The face is widened by adjusting counters and other spaces, and paying close attention to the balance of each character's shape. The Kana characters are made slightly smaller than the Kanji characters to give the right amount of rhythm when forming long sentences in fine weights.

## About TypeBank

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://googlefonts.github.io/morisawa-biz-ud-gothic/.
